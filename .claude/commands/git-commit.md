Write a **clear, concise, and well-scoped** Git commit message for the changes you have just made.
Follow these rules:

1. **Scope**: Each commit should represent one logical change only. If multiple unrelated changes exist, split them into separate commits.
2. **Summary line**:
  - Short and specific (aim for â‰¤ 50 characters if possible)
  - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
  - Describe *what* was changed in a way that will make sense months later
3. **Description (optional)**:
  - Explain *why* the change was made and any important context
  - Focus on reasoning, not low-level implementation details
  - Wrap lines at about 72 characters
4. **Granularity**:
  - Avoid combining unrelated modifications
  - Keep commits small enough to be easy to review, but large enough to be meaningful
5. **Do NOT add any extra text such as**:
  - Tool or model signatures (e.g., ðŸ¤– Generated with ...)
  - Author attributions like Co-Authored-By: ... unless explicitly instructed
  - Timestamps or commit hashes
  - Promotional or irrelevant content
